InflationX: Analyzing India's Cost of Living with CPI & Time Series Forecasting

In this project, I analyzed India’s inflation trends using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the govdata.xlsx file. My goal was to understand how the cost of living has changed over time and what’s driving it.
I started by loading and cleaning the data, fixing missing values, formatting dates, and organizing the dataset for analysis. Then, I processed the data to calculate monthly and yearly trends, percentage changes, and rolling averages.
Next, I did exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study patterns across different categories like food, fuel, housing, and health. I looked at seasonal trends, identified which categories were most volatile, and compared the growth of essentials vs. non-essentials over time.
I also used time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet to forecast future inflation trends, especially for key sectors like Fuel and Light. Finally, I analyzed correlations between categories and explored how events like COVID-19 and government policies affected inflation.
This project helped me draw meaningful insights about India’s inflation behavior and the shifting cost of living.
